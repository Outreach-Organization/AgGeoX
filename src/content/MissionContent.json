  "text": "Students will use languages and frameworks such as Python and QGIS to create heatmaps and visualize sorghum field trial data, while simultaneously developing models to predict plant traits like yield, protein content, and chlorophyll fluorescence. They will also utilize TensorBoard to monitor and track their modeling progress, gaining a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and machine learning techniques throughout the project."
