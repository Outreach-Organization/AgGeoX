  "text": "Students will set up their data analysis environment, create heatmaps using QGIS and Python, and visualize sorghum field trial data, all while developing predictive models for traits like yield, protein content, and chlorophyll fluorescence. They will also install and use TensorBoard to track preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance throughout the modeling process.Students will use languages and frameworks such as Python and QGIS to create heatmaps and visualize sorghum field trial data, while simultaneously developing models to predict plant traits such as yield, protein content, and chlorophyll fluorescence. They will also utilize TensorBoard to monitor and track their modeling progress, gaining a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and machine learning techniques throughout the project."
